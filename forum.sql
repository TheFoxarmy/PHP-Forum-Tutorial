(12, 'Fox McCloud', 'fox@starfox.com', 'Krystal1255', 18, 'Early life Fox was raised by his father on Corneria, but he was born on Papetoon. He exhibited exceptional aerial skills and even ground based combat skills at a young age and joined the Cornerian Flight Academy along with Slippy Toad, Bill Grey and possibly Falco Lombardi.  Five years after the evil mad scientist Andross was arrested, tried for treason and exiled to the outlandish planet Venom, General Pepper had received reports from Corneria\'s observation station about signs of bio-weaponry activity, and sent James McCloud and his Star Fox team on a recon mission on Venom to investigate, but James and Peppy were betrayed by their fellow pilot Pigma and gave them to his new master, Andross. Peppy soon barely managed to escape captivity, but James was never seen again and was presumed to have been killed by Andross, with apparent rumored assistance from Wolf O\'Donnell.  Peppy returned from the incident as the sole survivor to apprise Fox of his father\'s fate. Emotionally apprehended by the news, Fox dropped out of the Academy in order to avenge his father\'s death, but couldn\'t bring himself to believe that his father was truly gone. Peppy took Fox under his wing, and together composed a new Star Fox team, recruiting Falco and Slippy to the team and inheriting his father\'s Great Fox, ROB 64 and the great financial debt. Even though Peppy was older than all the other Star Fox Team members, he declined the leadership role and insisted that the younger Fox McCloud take over the team after Fox\'s father, James McCloud apparently made this his last wish. Feeling guilty about sending James to his doom, General Pepper also took it upon himself to manage Fox\'s future career. Fox knew that Bill would join Star Fox if he was asked to but didn\'t want to pull Bill into this troubles.  Lylat Wars A few years after the disappearance of James McCloud, Star Fox was called upon by General Pepper to stop Andross\'s empire and preserve the Lylat System. Fox led an incipient Star Fox team throughout the battles in the Lylat System, running into allies and enemies alike. His friendship with Bill Grey was revealed during one of these missions, and he went head-to-head with his rival Wolf O\'Donnell of Star Wolf and others. Once Star Fox reached Venom, they fought through its defensive lines or Star Wolf all the way to Andross\'s base. Despite the protests of his team, Fox faced Andross alone. After Fox vanquished him, Andross self destructed, inclined to take Fox with him. Fox screamed at his impending doom, thinking it was the end... but then Fox\'s father, James McCloud, appeared to guide him out of the base, while in the way out he verbalized the famous quote "Never give up, trust your instincts" and mentioned how vigorous Fox has become, determinately evanescent when prosperously exiting the base. Fox then left victorious as Andross\' base exploded abaft him. They headed back to Corneria, where General Pepper offered to officially integrate Star Fox into the Cornerian army. With all due respect, Fox declined, stating that they preferred to do things their own way, while hearing a call from ROB that the Great Fox was ready to go and decreed that it was time for them to go too.   Titania Incident Four years after the Lylat Wars, the tranquility times have taken a heftily ponderous toll on the Star Fox team. After a training session with Falco (involving Game Boy-like contrivances and Arwings kindred to the pristine Star Fox design), he receives a Distress Signal from Katt Monroe. Falco left abruptly to endeavor and avail her, much to Fox and the rest of the team\'s protests. They then decided to visit the Cornerian research Base on Titania, meeting up with the officer in charge of the base, Captain Shears, and he accepted their request, though under one condition. Fox and his team were to wipe out some Andross remnants who were making off with some "data" relating to Andross\' research.  When Fox started fighting off the Androssian vessel, he then spotted another Arwing disembarking the ship, and realized that Falco seemed to have "defected" to the Androssians. Falco then commenced firing on Fox, thus coercing Fox to go into a dogfight with Falco. Falco taunts that barrel rolling was a bad move because Fox wouldn\'t have known where he would be after the move was over, but Fox turned the table by flying into the sunlight where Falco couldn\'t see, and launched a charged homing laser bolt, downing Falco.  At the Great Fox\'s hangar, Peppy scolded Fox for fighting with Falco, shaming him and asking what his father would say before he asked why Fox got into the Dogfight in the first place. Fox then explained that Falco had emerged from the Androssian ship, ostensibly siding with them. Peppy then felt perturbed at what he\'s hearing. Fox then admitted feeling suspicious about Shear\'s true motivations. Shortly after Slippy was sent to the base to investigate (much to his chagrin, as he had deplorable recollections from the last time he visited the planet), the accused Androssians hail the Star Fox team. It turned out the "Androssians" were genuinely Katt Monroe\'s team, the Hot Rodders, and that they were never affiliated with Andross. In fact, the reason why they had been on the planet is because they discovered data pertaining to the project that Shear\'s is involved in and was intending to expose it. After learning from ROB that the project authentically involved cloning Andross, they learned that Slippy had been captured by the research facility under Shear\'s command.  Following Peppy\'s directions to Slippy\'s cell, Fox and the Hot Rodders cooperated to foil Shear\'s plans and rescue Slippy. Fox and Shears had a sword duel that mostly involved Shears chasing Fox around on his Titanian River Boar. Lamentably, the Andross clone had matured far more rapidly than anticipated thanks to Slippy accidentally speeding up the process and the clone liberated itself from the cloning container in a fit of rage by seeing and remembering Fox. Fox endeavored to apprehend Shears, but when Shears endeavored to elude, he ended up being killed by his very own endangerment, and Andross then endeavors to suck Fox in. Upon Slippy\'s return they then notice that the Landmaster is still in the docking bay, and Fox endeavors to utilize a Nova Bomb on Andross to endeavor and ravage him, eradicating the base and proximately killing himself and Slippy in the process.  After learning that Falco was taking some time away from the team at least for the time being, Fox heeded Falco\'s last request and told Katt that she and her friends should disband the Hot-Rodders.  Four years later, Fox was training with Slippy (albeit this time with a model resembling the Game Boy Advance), and he beats Slippy (causing him to remark that Slippy\'s not authentically an adequate rival). He asks ROB for any job requests, but ROB informed him that no official requests have been made for them, but he does have a concern for a particular planet. Fox then decides with the remnant of the Star Fox team that they should endeavor and preserve it. Presumably, they sent a request sanction to General Pepper for carrying out the mission.  Plight of Sauria Eight years after the events of the Lylat Wars, a way more cocky and immature Fox McCloud calmed the conflict on Dinosaur Planet (later kenned as "Sauria") by teaming with Prince Tricky of the EarthWalker tribe and returning the SpellStones to their rightful positions in two of the planet\'s temples, liberating a confined Krystal by returning the five remaining Krazoa Spirits to their rightful positions, thwarting the orchestrations of General Scales, and vanquishing a reawakened Andross, who was abaft the troubles on Sauria. He was verboten from bringing his blaster into the mission by Pepper as a condition to accepting the mission, as Pepper believed that they needed to solve the quandary without resorting to brute force, albeit he nonetheless managed to make do with a staff that he found near the landing site which pristinely belonged to Krystal. After that, he returned to the Great Fox, and General Pepper paid him for preserving Sauria. He and Falco Lombardi (who had left after the events of the Titanian incident.) were reunited, and Krystal joined the Star Fox Team. Immediately afterwards, the Star Fox Team ostensibly utilized the mazuma that Fox received to rehabilitate the Great Fox, as well as oiling ROB 64 and upgrading the Arwings and Landmasters.  Aparoid Invasion A year since the events of the Saurian Crisis, after arriving at Fortuna to assist in ending an Androssian rebellion led by Andrew Oikonny at General Pepper\'s request, Fox discovered something bigger and more serious has just begun when Oikonny\'s flagship was shot down down by a "strange creature". After it made an attempt on Krystal, Fox ordered a return fire and destroyed it, where it left behind a interesting object which Peppy prompted him to collect before making a hasty retreat from an approaching armada.   After sending the Core memory to Corneria\'s research labs, General Pepper and Beltino Toad briefed Fox and his team about the uprising of the aparoid race, while telling a tragic tale about a sole aparoid destroying an entire Cornerian fleet seventeen years ago, fearing it was foreshadowing the future.  Beltino assured Fox that his federation scientists were making an full analysis but urged that they could understand more if a complete, undamaged specimen were brought in. Pepper then instructed Fox and his team to investigate a distress signal coming from the outpost base on Katina, suspecting aparoid involvement. Once destroying the force leader and heading to collect its Core memory, Fox noticed that the distress signal had stopped transmitting, only to find out that the traitorous Pigma was behind the S.O.S signal and stole the core memory in order to sell it, deducing from Fox\'s protest that it was important. Though angry at the sight of Pigma and losing the Core memory, Fox opted to give chase to him.  Tracking Pigma to a dodgy hideout, Team Star Fox\'s search provoked an aggressive attack from various criminals after they learned who they were. Star Wolf arrived on the scene to settle old scores but it ended badly for Wolf\'s team, who then revealed that Pigma was thrown off of Star Wolf and he couldn\'t have hidden at the hideout without being driven out. Star Wolf\'s newest member, Panther Caroso fell for the beauty of Krystal and slip gave that they might find Pigma at Fichina.  On Fichina, after shutting down the protective shield, turning the climate control center back on and getting attacked by sentry bots, Slippy revealed that they had undergone Aparoidedation, while Pigma flew down to sadistically reveal he was "pulling the strings" and raising an infected shield generator. Once the machine was downed, the climate control center was saved, as Peppy made an ironic remark about "those with strong wills", "allies or enemies". Fox said that it sounded like someone he knew. Finding Pigma\'s trail leading through the asteroid belt and cutting through the aparoids, Fox watched as Pigma underwent an unusual transformation and fused with an abandoned space station, forcing him to destroy the assimilated station and take back the core memory. Fox looked on in silence as Pigma faced a painful destruction.  Heading back to Corneria and transmitting the core memory, General Pepper then revealed that their plan was to take the fight to the Queen, or else the threat would never end. But their return home to Corneria was interrupted when Krystal caught the telepathic sounds of "cries of agony" coming from Sauria. Fox was horrified to see that Sauria\'s dinosaurs were victims of Aparoidedation caused by Aparoid hatchers and decided to save the planet once again. Once the aparoids were wiped out, Fox and Krystal had a short but sweet reunion with Tricky, who offered to take care of things so they could "come back on their honeymoon", sparking a friendly argument but to Fox\'s embarrassment.  Fox and the team then learned the hard way that their absence left Corneria vulnerable to a colossal aparoid armada, decimating the majority of the Cornerian defense fleet, and lost contact with General Pepper as a result. Fighting on the surface and rebooting the communications, Fox was then ambushed by aparoids, but then shockingly was saved by none other than Wolf and his team. Siding with their rivals against a common foe, Fox brought down many aparoids, including reluctantly taking down General Pepper\'s infected flagship, (but Pepper was timely saved by Peppy). Wolf then departed from the planet after remarking that he hadn\'t come here to save Fox, whilst giving a familiar sounding piece of advice, prompting Fox to reconsider his thoughts about his rivalry with Wolf.   After regrouping with Beltino, the plan was set to take the new self-destruct program to the aparoid homeworld and fire it into the queen, destroying their race. Defending the orbital gate, Star Fox shipped out via a portal to make their final stand against the aparoids, accompanied by the remaining Cornerian fleets. On the planet\'s surface, Fox and Krystal took out the hatchers to try and disable the large shield covering the planet\'s core, but the shield reformed barring any entry. At the cost of their mothership, Peppy and ROB, Fox reluctantly respected Peppy\'s will and ordered that the team moves on, without him. Flying down the tunnels, Star Fox were then joined by their rivals, Star Wolf, just one more time, where the three Wolfen led a lethal barricade away from the Arwings to let them reach the queen.  Ignoring the queen\'s imitations of those closest to him, including his father, Fox fought the queen, breaking through her defenses and delivering the program, only to have to battle her one more time before she could escape and created an anti-body. Escaping the planet at maximum velocity, Fox theorized that the whole thing was one big entity and that she tried to bypass evolution by stealing souls, but knowing that "you have to be born with one". Reuniting with Peppy in space, Fox admits he knew the old rabbit would be all right all along, and knowing that Pepper would be fine too and feeling Wolf\'s team would live to fight another day, thanking his friends for their support.  Anglar Blitz Once again, the Lylat System falls under peril, this time under attack by an incipient foe kenned as the Anglar army, who originated from Venom\'s acidic oceans. It was up to Fox to preserve the galaxy once more by gradually liberating invaded territory and arriving at Venom to vanquish the Anglar Emperor. This time, he commenced the battle with only ROB 64 at his side, as the team had been disbanded for sundry reasons.  Along the way, other characters joined Fox and the team became whole again. In a special ending, Fox finds a deep secret about his father but it ostensibly doesn\'t phase him nor does he seem to descry.', 'male', 'StarFox_McCloud', 'https://www.watsonmartin.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/default-profile-picture.jpg'),

(16, 'Samus', 'samus@metriod.com', 'metroidXchemicalThing', 24, '	Samus Aran is a bounty hunter that has worked with the Galactic Federation several times in the past, having exterminated the Metroids, Space Pirates, Ridley, Mother Brain, Metroid Prime/Dark Samus, Phazon, the Ing, Gorea, the Galactic Federation Bioweapons Program (Special-forces unit) MB and X Parasites, along with terminating numerous hostile life-forms on various planets. 	Samus Aran was originally a native of the Earth colony K-2L. She was living with her parents, Rodney Aran and Virginia Aran, when, at the age of three, the colony was visited by the Chozo. The Chozo had come in hopes of gaining some of the Afloraltite the colony mined there, but the colony was unwilling to give them any. Samus, however, caught the attention of Old Bird, one of the Chozo elders. The two of them went for a walk, where they began to strike up a friendship. Samus began to call him “Grandpa” and Old Bird introduced her to her new pet, Pyonchi.  However, a Space Pirate raid led by Ridley soon commenced on the colony. Samus herself had an encounter with Ridley, where she asked if they could become friends. Humiliated in front of his troops, Ridley attempted to kill Samus, but her mother pushed Samus out of the way at the cost of her own life. Meanwhile, Samus\' father sacrificed himself to destroy Ridley’s flagship. Little did Ridley know that, in killing Samus’ mother and attempting to kill Samus, he had succeeded in creating his greatest enemy.  Kid Samus A young Samus during the attack on K-2L. Samus was the sole survivor of the attack on K-2L. Eventually, the same group of Chozo found her alone and stranded on the destroyed colony, and Old Bird decided to take custody of Samus. The Chozo brought her to their planet, Zebes, and raised her with Chozo influence. Samus was infused with Chozo blood [1] in order to boost her chances of survival on Zebes; she was later given the powerful bio-mechanical Power Suit built entirely from Chozo technology.  Samus trained under the Chozo for many years. By the age of 14, she was already well past the physical limits of ordinary humans. The Chozo were unsure at first of her ability to become a true warrior until they witnessed her compassion for a flock of Iono Feria that had gone insane as a result of exposure to Badger Clovers. Old Bird told Samus that she had his confidence and she immediately left the planet for the Federation. 	Samus joined the Federation Police, where she excelled far above any at the academy. Eventually, she was promoted to the Star-Trackers, an elite force that only one out of a million police officers is qualified for. Under Chief Hardy, one of her early assignments was to the human planet Jigrad, which the Space Pirates had recently enslaved and construction something. Samus, alongside her squadmates, Kreatz and Mauk, were sent to observe. When the pirates threatened to execute child slave Damara, simply for being unfit for work, Samus and her squad attacked without orders. This lead to the first Federation imprisonment and interrogation of a Space Pirate, a matter which also involved the military Adam Malkovich, leading to Samus and Adams first introduction. The interrogation revealed that the space pirate’s actions on Jidrad was a simple distraction from their invasion of the Chozo’s planet Zebes. Hardy ordered Samus to wait for the Army to be deployed, but Samus, Kreatz, and Mauk disobeyed Federation orders and travel to Zebes to help the Chozo. After a run-in with Adam, she was told she was given 48 hours before the army arrived. Samus, Kreatz and Mauk arrive at Zebes, and find out that the Space Pirates are hoping to gain the whole of Chozo knowledge. The Chozo have either fled or surrendered, and the first Metroid is rogue in the base. Samus discovered that Mother Brain and the Chozo Gray Voice have established a "satisfactory cooperative relationship" with the Pirates. In this relationship, Mother Brain will be the new leader of the space pirates, which will reunite the galaxy. Mother Brain offers Samus the role of "master" of the Space Pirates, an offer she quickly refuses. At this time Ridley arrives and taunts Samus over the death of her parents and her failure to join the pirates. All this causes Samus to fall into a state of posttraumatic stress disorder due to repressed memories of the K-2L attack. Samus was saved later by her squad mates causing a distant distraction, and the newly rescued Chozo help Samus get over her posttraumatic stress. Ridley attacks the group and Samus dons her power suit and defends the party from Ridley. Ridley then retreats to defend Mother Brain from an attack by Gray Voice, who revealed his true allegiance and is attacking the "defective product", Mother Brain. Samus learns of Gray Voice’s plight from the rescued Chozo Platinum Chest, and while wanting to help and fight, decides to help the evacuation of the Chozo and her team mates. While escaping, Samus feels Gray Voice\'s battle struggles, due to their shared DNA (Samus got Chozo DNA to survive Zebes when she was a child), through this link she hears his last request.  "Samus, I leave the rest to you. You have become strong, so strong. Samus I know that your fate is harsh, but, though this will be hard for you, there are many people in the universe who need your strength, I want you to save them, be it only one or many, I want you to help them, this is my request. You have become strong, my child."  After breaking atmosphere in an ancient Chozo ship, the Space Pirate Flagship looms ahead, but they are rescues by the Federation Army, lead by the Federation Army Special Ops Battleship VIXIV, commanded by General Adam Malkovich. 	After the Infiltration of Zebes, Samus,(between 15–17 years old) worked on the VIXIV under General Adam Malkovich. Here she met Anthony Higgs and Adam\'s younger brother, Ian Malkovich. It is unknown how long she served with Adam’s unit, but long enough to develop a strong relationship with Anthony, Ian and Adam. Adam would always finish his orders with the question, "Any objections, Lady?" as a way of cementing the trust between the two of them. Samus felt like Adam was the only person who truly understood her, Samus grew to view him as her best friend and surrogate father figure. Samus left the VIXIV after the death of Adam\'s brother, Ian, whom Adam sacrificed to save 300 innocents on the Lusitania. 	Samus vanished completely, abandoning her post in the GF Police. In Metroid: Other M, she states her reason for doing so was that she was still young and relatively inexperienced at the time. Samus did not resurface until a few years later; by this time, she had become universally-renowned as a Bounty Hunter by single-handedly hunting down numerous Space Pirates, including stopping an assassination attempt at the inauguration of Chairman Keaton. So much of her life during this time is shrouded in mystery that the public believes her to be a male cyborg, not the same woman who graduated first in her class at the GF Police. 	After becoming the most famed and capable of all Bounty Hunters, succeeding in missions everyone considered impossible, Samus was summoned by the Galactic Federation. Previously, a Federation Planet Reclamation Division had been sent to capture Metroid specimens for study, but the Space Pirates had swept in, killed the crew, and stolen the Metroids. The capture of this creature was a disastrous blow to the Federation. A Metroid could leech life from its victims, was impervious to most weaponry, and could be cheaply cloned by exposure to beta rays for 24 standard hours. The Pirates had already tested their potential in a three-way simultaneous attack on several Federation worlds; the attack was a stunning success for the Pirates, who had suffered no casualties at all. With hundreds of Metroids under their power, the Space Pirates would inevitably begin a campaign to conquer the rest of the universe. Galactic Civilization would end.  After a long and harrowing search, the Federation Police tracked the Pirates to Zebes. They launched an invasion, but Pirate resistance was too strong. After much debate, the Federation decided to turn to Samus to infiltrate the base at Zebes. She was given two objectives:  ’’’Destroy all Metroid organisms.’’’ and ’’’Defeat the Mechanical Life-Form Mother Brain.’’’ 	Samus arrived on Zebes and soon discovered that in order to access the central Space Pirate base in Tourian, she had to kill the two Pirate leaders situated on the planet: her old foe, Ridley, and his partner Kraid. After discovering various Chozo artifacts located in multiple locations on the planet that served as upgrades for her suit, Samus was finally able to access the lower depths of Brinstar, where she discovered Kraid waiting for her. A fierce battle ensued, with Samus ultimately coming out the winner. Samus then headed into the deep volcanic regions of Zebes, where she had several surprising encounters with Imagos, gigantic insects that grew from enormous grub-like larvae. When Samus arrived at Ridley’s lair, she soon encountered the Pirate leader, who had just arrived moments earlier after being sent to inspect the planet. Samus fought him with a murderous lust, finally being able to avenge her parents’ death. Unbeknownst to Samus, though Ridley was nearly burned alive after their battle, he did not die from his wounds.  After defeating Kraid and Ridley, Samus was granted access to Tourian, where she discovered that the Space Pirates had underestimated the Metroids’ intelligence. A massive breakout had occurred, and all Pirate personnel present at the time of the breakout were dead. Mother Brain herself, however, was protected by her Chozo-built facility and so was completely unharmed. As a result, Metroid cloning had proceeded as though nothing happened, so the Metroid population had risen to an astonishing level. Samus engaged the Metroids she encountered but found that they were impervious to most of her weaponry. Only by exploiting their weakness to cold with the Ice Beam could Samus hope to overcome them.  Samus soon arrived at Mother Brain’s chamber and fought her way past the defense systems. The two engaged in an arduous duel, but Mother Brain was ultimately defeated. Unfortunately for Samus, Mother Brain\'s death activated a hidden fail-safe that began a countdown for the self-destruction of the entire Pirate base. Samus barely managed to make it out to her gunship in time. 	Unfortunately, escape was not easy as Samus thought it would be. As soon she left the atmosphere, Space Pirate Fighters ambushed her; during the ensuing chase, Samus was shot down, and her ship crash-landed back on Zebes. Samus survived, but the explosion had destroyed her Power Suit. The only weapon left available to her was a mostly-useless stun pistol. Her only option was to sneak inside the Space Pirate Mother Ship, which had landed in a nearby valley, in hopes of hijacking a ship and escaping. The next morning, Samus climbed in through the ductwork and began her infiltration. Unfortunately, her plans were quickly botched when she was spotted by several Pirates, who quickly set off alarms throughout the entire ship. Though she managed to outwit them many times, Samus was ultimately forced to retreat to the nearby ruins of Chozodia.  In the ruins, Samus discovered a sacred Ruins Test which she had visited once as a young child. Upon her discovery, the Test activated; Samus had to face a mirror image of herself along with powerful bolts of lightning hurled by the hieroglyphic. Ultimately, Samus succeeded in passing the test, and the statue rewarded her with the Legendary Power Suit, and unlocked the three Unknown Items: the Plasma Beam, the Gravity Suit, and the Space Jump. Now more powerful than before, Samus stormed the Pirate Mothership, leaving many dead Pirates in her wake.  Eventually, Samus made it to the bridge of the Mothership where she discovered the Ridley Robot, a gigantic robot built in Ridley’s likeness. The robot engaged her in a fierce battle, but Samus was easily able to destroy it. As it shut down, it activated the self-destruct for the Pirate Mothership. Samus raced through the corridors of the Mothership, battling numerous Pirates along the way, until she managed to hijack a Space Pirate fighter. Samus quickly flew out of the ship and left Zebes as the Pirate Mothership exploded behind her. Samus had fulfilled her Zero Mission.
